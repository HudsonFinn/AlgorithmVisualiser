# Algorithm Visualiser

This repo is for the website hosted at https://visualiser.app/, it visualises some of the most well known sorting algorithms
and gives some more information on them including their time and space complexity, where they should be used and a video explaining them. (I did not create the videos but have left credit to the creators under each video).
