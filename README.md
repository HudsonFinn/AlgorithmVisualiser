# ListSorting

This repo is for the website hosted at https://visualiser.app/, it visualises some of the most well known sorting algorithms
and gives some more information on them including their time and space complexity, where they should be used and a video explaining them. (I did not create the videos but have left credit to the creators under each video).

The main page allows you to control the contents of the sorted lists and start the visualisation.
